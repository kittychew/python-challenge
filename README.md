# PyBank Financial Analysis

    ## Overview
    This project analyzes financial records from a dataset (`budget_data.csv`) using Python. It calculates various financial metrics including total number of months, net profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period.

    ## Dataset
    The dataset (`budget_data.csv`) consists of two columns:
    - **Date**: Date of the financial record.
    - **Profit/Losses**: Financial profit or loss for the corresponding month.

    ## Requirements
    - Python (version 3. recommended)
    - CSV module (standard library in Python)

    ## Installation
    1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/kittychew/python-challenge>
    cd /Users/katchu/Desktop/Data Analysis Bootcamp/python-challenge/PyBank/main.py
    2. Install necessary dependencies

    ## Usage
    1. Ensure Python and necessary modules are installed.
    2. Run the Python script main.py to perform financial analysis on budget_data.csv.

    ## Files
        •	main.py: Python script for financial analysis.
        •	budget_data.csv: Dataset containing financial records.

    ## Output
    Upon running main.py, the script will print the following financial metrics to the console:

        •	Total Number of Months
        •	Net Profit and Losses
        •	Average Change in Profit/Loss
        •	Greatest Increase in Profits (Date and Amount)
        •	Greatest Decrease in Profits (Date and Amount)

# PyPoll:Vote Counting

    ## Overview
    This project aims to modernize the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using Python. We analyze election data provided in a CSV file (election_data.csv) to calculate and display the following election metrics:

	•	The total number of votes cast
	•	A complete list of candidates who received votes
	•	The percentage of votes each candidate won
	•	The total number of votes each candidate won
	•	The winner of the election based on popular vote

    ## Dataset
    The dataset (election_data.csv) consists of three columns:

	•	Voter ID: Unique identifier for each voter.
	•	County: County where the vote was cast.
	•	Candidate: Name of the candidate voted for by the voter.

    ## Requirements
    - Python (version 3. recommended)
    - CSV module (standard library in Python)

    ## Installation
    1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/kittychew/python-challenge>
    cd /Users/katchu/Desktop/Data Analysis Bootcamp/python-challenge/PyPoll/main.py
    2. Install necessary dependencies

    ## Usage
    1.	Ensure Python and necessary modules are installed.
	2.	Run the Python script main.py to perform election analysis on election_data.csv.

    ## Files
        •	main.py: Python script for election analysis.
	    •	election_data.csv: Dataset containing election records.

    ## Output
    Upon running main.py, the script will print the following election results to the console:
        •	Total Votes: Total number of votes cast
        •	List of Candidates: Each candidate who received votes, with their percentage of the total vote and total number of votes received
        •	Winner: Name of the candidate who won the election based on popular vote
