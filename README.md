# PyBank Financial Analysis

    ## Overview
    This project analyzes financial records from a dataset (`budget_data.csv`) using Python. It calculates various financial metrics including total number of months, net profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period.

    The dataset (`budget_data.csv`) consists of two columns:
    - **Date**: Date of the financial record.
    - **Profit/Losses**: Financial profit or loss for the corresponding month.

    ## Requirements
    - Python (version 3. recommended)
    - CSV module (standard library in Python)
